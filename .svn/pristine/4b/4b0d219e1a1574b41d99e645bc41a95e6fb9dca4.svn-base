Among them were Toronto FC keeper Julio Cesar; defenders David Luiz (Chelsea), Thiago Silva (Paris Saint-Germain) and Dani Alves (Barcelona); Chelsea midfielder teammates Oscar, Ramires and Willian; and forwards Fred (Fluminese), Hulk (Zenit St. Petersburg) and Neymar (Barcelona).Among the omissions were three former world players of the year in Kaka, Robinho and Ronaldinho, all of whom are well past their prime, as well as 21-year-old Liverpool midfielder Philippe Coutinho and Manchester United’s Rafael Pereira da Silva, a 23-year-old right back.Now comes the hard part for Scolari: convincing Brazilians that this team is worth the $11-billion investment the country made in the World Cup.Whether..."

Our combined income is $58,000, we own our home outright, and we have no debt, no children, $84,000 in a traditional IRA and $90,000 in a stock portfolio.I just sold a portion of a mutual fund for a $30,000 gain that is in the bank for the time being. How long do we have to reinvest without paying a capital gains tax? Or would it be best to pay the tax now, leave the money in the bank and be done with it?Answer:Unless you sell another investment for a $30,000 loss to offset the gain, you're going to have to pay taxes on your profit.There is no way to do a tax-free reinvestment, said tax professional Eva Rosenberg, an enrolled agent who runs theTaxMama.comsite.
